# dotfiles

My dotfiles, including vim and git configuration. Synmlik script generates symbolic links to files in home directory that can be used for editing and accessing like the files were located in that folder. 

To run symlink script, type the following terminal commands:
chmod +x makesymlinks.sh
./makesymlinks.sh
